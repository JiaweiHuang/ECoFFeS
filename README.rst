Introduction
-----------------------------------

Recent decade has witnessed significant progress in the develop-ment of feature selection for many bioinformatics and cheminfor-matics applications, such as sequence analysis, microarray analy-sis, mass spectra (MS) analysis, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis, and quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) analysis. Compared with other dimen-sionality reduction techniques, feature selection merely selects a feature subset and does not alter the original representation of the features. Thus, the selected feature subset preserves the semantics of the features while offering the ad-vantage of interpretability. For example, in QSAR analysis, the selected feature subset improves the interpretability of relationship between descriptors and biological activities.
However, feature selection remains a challenging task due to the fact that it is an NP-hard problem, in which the total number of possible feature subsets is 2^n-1 (n is the number of features). To deal with this issue, many search methods have been proposed, such as complete search, greedy search, and heuristic search. Nevertheless, most of them tend to suffer from stag-nation in a local optimum. Evolutionary computation, as a kind of powerful global search method inspired by nature, has attracted a high level of interest from the feature selection research community. For the purpose of further boosting evolutionary computation for feature selection, we develop a user-friendly and standalone software named ECoFFeS (Evolutionary Computation For Feature Selection).
